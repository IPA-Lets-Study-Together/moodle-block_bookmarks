About IPA Let's Study Together Project:
-----------------------------------------
The repository contains Moodle plugins developed for blind and visually impaired persons in a scope of the project "IPA Let's study together" (University of Split, Faculty of Economics, 2013) financed by European Union through IPA funds. The project is also an initiative to enable visually impaired persons to study at two Faculties in Split; the Faculty of Economics and the Faculty of Philosophy. Hence the title of the project, "Let's study together" which reflects the project's philosophy that adequate conditions must be put in place at the two faculties both for the education and the social inclusion of blind and visually impaired persons.
